1) Imbalanced training set
    - Imbalanced dataset sampler

2) Different Architectures
    - neurons/channels number
    - number/type of layers
    - type of activation functions
    - hyperparameters (LR...)
        - Adam optimizer (?)

3)  a) Increased dataset
    b) Data augmentation (torchvision)

Python Imaging Library (PIL) is the "format" of the images
Torchvision.Compose() wraps the transforms you want to apply to your PIL dataset (images basically)
    - You may want to use .ToTensor() and Normalize() (literally just normalizes (std and mean))

- Images are given in different sizes, so a re-scaling of images is necessary for detecting correctly.

- Optional solution shown, didn't understand

- What does it mean to have more than 1 convolution?

- When you give an example of a face to a system, balance it with an example of a non face xd

- Flag 0 on imread() is for reading in grayscale mode
